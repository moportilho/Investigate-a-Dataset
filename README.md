# Investigate-a-Dataset
Udacity project for Investigate a Dataset

For the project, I conduct the data analysis and create a file to share that documents my own findings. I started by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions that I am most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers. I was not required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I should make it clear in my communications what findings my are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
